## GitHub Profile Description

### ðŸš€ Vectron: A High-Performance Vector Database in Rust

I built Vectron to explore the intersection of AI and systems programming. This project combines the performance benefits of Rust with the AI capabilities of modern embedding models to create a lightweight but powerful vector database.

Key highlights:
- Generates embeddings from text using HuggingFace models
- Stores and retrieves vectors with sub-millisecond latency
- Implements cosine similarity search for semantic matching
- Provides a complete REST API for all operations
- Includes benchmarking and persistence capabilities

This project demonstrates my ability to work across the stack, from ML model integration to low-level performance optimization.

## Why I Built a Vector Database in Rust

Vector databases are at the heart of modern AI applications, enabling semantic search, recommendation systems, and more. I chose to implement Vectron in Rust for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety make it ideal for performance-critical applications like vector search
2. **Learning**: Building a vector database from scratch helped me understand the core algorithms and data structures that power AI infrastructure
3. **Integration**: Combining Rust's systems programming with Python's ML ecosystem showcases how to bridge these two worlds effectively
4. **Modern Architecture**: The project demonstrates clean API design, modular architecture, and proper error handling

The most challenging aspect was optimizing the similarity search algorithm for both speed and accuracy. By implementing cosine similarity with proper vector normalization, Vectron achieves excellent search results while maintaining high performance.

For future extensions, I'm considering implementing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms like HNSW to handle even larger vector collections efficiently.
